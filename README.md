# Ambient Forge

![Ambient Forge](public/store-hero.svg)

Ambient Forge is an open-source sound scene mixer for [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/). Build layered scenes from music, ambience, voices, and effects, then keep playback synchronized with everyone at your table.

Review build: **0.1.11** — playback lifecycle fixes, random launch, status feedback, and buffered seamless loops. See `AUDIT_RU.md` and `INSTALL_RU.md`. This build has not been deployed to the upstream manifest URL.

## Install

Add this manifest URL as a custom Owlbear Rodeo extension:

```text
https://ambient-forge.marevo.workers.dev/manifest.json
```

Learn more at [ambient-forge.marevo.workers.dev/about](https://ambient-forge.marevo.workers.dev/about).

## Features

- Layer multiple tracks in a single sound scene.
- Launch one random scene from a folder, or one random unmuted track from a scene.
- Enable Seamless loop for short direct audio files (up to 120 sec / 12 MiB; CORS required).
- Organize scenes into colored folders with custom emoji icons.
- Play direct MP3, OGG, WAV, and YouTube sources.
- Paste public Dropbox share links without manually changing their URL parameters.
- Control master, scene, and individual track volume.
- Pause and resume without restarting a scene.
- Configure looping, randomized repeat delays, fade in, and fade out.
- Synchronize playback with the room or keep it private to the game master.
- Import and export complete libraries as `.aforge` files.
- Import compatible Djinni music-player libraries.
- Keep audio playing while the extension popover is closed.

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 22.12 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Add `http://localhost:5173/manifest.json` as a custom extension. For a standalone visual preview, open `http://localhost:5173/?preview=1`.

Create a production build with:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Data and privacy

Ambient Forge stores your sound library locally in the browser. Use **Export** to make a portable backup before clearing browser data or moving to another device. Room playback state is shared only as needed to synchronize audio in Owlbear Rodeo.
